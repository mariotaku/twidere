Thats all my stuffs to develop Twidere (Taken by my SONY Xperia ray, it's my another Android device).

This netbook (HASEE Q130B, 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270, $300 in 2009) is nearly broken, the desktop computer behind it works fine, but it only have 1GB RAM. It's too small to run Eclipse and Android Emulator.

So, buy me a RAM stick, a bread or anything you want :)
