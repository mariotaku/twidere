/***
 * FTPClient encapsulates all the functionality necessary to store and
 * retrieve files from an FTP server.  This class takes care of all
 * low level details of interacting with an FTP server and provides
 * a convenient higher level interface.  As with all classes derived
 * from {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient},
 * you must first connect to the server with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#connect  connect }
 * before doing anything, and finally
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#disconnect  disconnect }
 * after you're completely finished interacting with the server.
 * Then you need to check the FTP reply code to see if the connection
 * was successful.  For example:
 * <pre>
 *    boolean error = false;
 *    try {
 *      int reply;
 *      ftp.connect("ftp.foobar.com");
 *      System.out.println("Connected to " + server + ".");
 *      System.out.print(ftp.getReplyString());
 *
 *      // After connection attempt, you should check the reply code to verify
 *      // success.
 *      reply = ftp.getReplyCode();
 *
 *      if(!FTPReply.isPositiveCompletion(reply)) {
 *        ftp.disconnect();
 *        System.err.println("FTP server refused connection.");
 *        System.exit(1);
 *      }
 *      ... // transfer files
 *      ftp.logout();
 *    } catch(IOException e) {
 *      error = true;
 *      e.printStackTrace();
 *    } finally {
 *      if(ftp.isConnected()) {
 *        try {
 *          ftp.disconnect();
 *        } catch(IOException ioe) {
 *          // do nothing
 *        }
 *      }
 *      System.exit(error ? 1 : 0);
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Immediately after connecting is the only real time you need to check the
 * reply code (because connect is of type void).  The convention for all the
 * FTP command methods in FTPClient is such that they either return a
 * boolean value or some other value.
 * The boolean methods return true on a successful completion reply from
 * the FTP server and false on a reply resulting in an error condition or
 * failure.  The methods returning a value other than boolean return a value
 * containing the higher level data produced by the FTP command, or null if a
 * reply resulted in an error condition or failure.  If you want to access
 * the exact FTP reply code causing a success or failure, you must call
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyCode  getReplyCode } after
 * a success or failure.
 * <p>
 * The default settings for FTPClient are for it to use
 * <code> FTP.ASCII_FILE_TYPE </code>,
 * <code> FTP.NON_PRINT_TEXT_FORMAT </code>,
 * <code> FTP.STREAM_TRANSFER_MODE </code>, and
 * <code> FTP.FILE_STRUCTURE </code>.  The only file types directly supported
 * are <code> FTP.ASCII_FILE_TYPE </code> and
 * <code> FTP.BINARY_FILE_TYPE </code>.  Because there are at least 4
 * different EBCDIC encodings, we have opted not to provide direct support
 * for EBCDIC.  To transfer EBCDIC and other unsupported file types you
 * must create your own filter InputStreams and OutputStreams and wrap
 * them around the streams returned or required by the FTPClient methods.
 * FTPClient uses the {@link ToNetASCIIOutputStream NetASCII}
 * filter streams to provide transparent handling of ASCII files.  We will
 * consider incorporating EBCDIC support if there is enough demand.
 * <p>
 * <code> FTP.NON_PRINT_TEXT_FORMAT </code>,
 * <code> FTP.STREAM_TRANSFER_MODE </code>, and
 * <code> FTP.FILE_STRUCTURE </code> are the only supported formats,
 * transfer modes, and file structures.
 * <p>
 * Because the handling of sockets on different platforms can differ
 * significantly, the FTPClient automatically issues a new PORT (or EPRT) command
 * prior to every transfer requiring that the server connect to the client's
 * data port.  This ensures identical problem-free behavior on Windows, Unix,
 * and Macintosh platforms.  Additionally, it relieves programmers from
 * having to issue the PORT (or EPRT) command themselves and dealing with platform
 * dependent issues.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, for security purposes, all data connections to the
 * client are verified to ensure that they originated from the intended
 * party (host and port).  If a data connection is initiated by an unexpected
 * party, the command will close the socket and throw an IOException.  You
 * may disable this behavior with
 * {@link #setRemoteVerificationEnabled setRemoteVerificationEnabled()}.
 * <p>
 * You should keep in mind that the FTP server may choose to prematurely
 * close a connection if the client has been idle for longer than a
 * given time period (usually 900 seconds).  The FTPClient class will detect a
 * premature FTP server connection closing when it receives a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPReply#SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE FTPReply.SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE }
 *  response to a command.
 * When that occurs, the FTP class method encountering that reply will throw
 * an {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPConnectionClosedException}
 * .
 * <code>FTPConnectionClosedException</code>
 * is a subclass of <code> IOException </code> and therefore need not be
 * caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its
 * catch block must appear before the more general <code> IOException </code>
 * catch block.  When you encounter an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPConnectionClosedException}
 * , you must disconnect the connection with
 * {@link #disconnect  disconnect() } to properly clean up the
 * system resources used by FTPClient.  Before disconnecting, you may check the
 * last reply code and text with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyCode  getReplyCode },
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyString  getReplyString },
 * and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyStrings  getReplyStrings}.
 * You may avoid server disconnections while the client is idle by
 * periodically sending NOOP commands to the server.
 * <p>
 * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that
 * every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException
 * can also throw a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException}
 * , which is a subclass
 * of IOException.  A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when
 * the reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol
 * specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite
 * attempts to be as lenient as possible.
 * <p>
 * Listing API Examples
 * Both paged and unpaged examples of directory listings are available,
 * as follows:
 * <p>
 * Unpaged (whole list) access, using a parser accessible by auto-detect:
 * <pre>
 *    FTPClient f = new FTPClient();
 *    f.connect(server);
 *    f.login(username, password);
 *    FTPFile[] files = listFiles(directory);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Paged access, using a parser not accessible by auto-detect.  The class
 * defined in the first parameter of initateListParsing should be derived
 * from org.apache.commons.net.FTPFileEntryParser:
 * <pre>
 *    FTPClient f = new FTPClient();
 *    f.connect(server);
 *    f.login(username, password);
 *    FTPListParseEngine engine =
 *       f.initiateListParsing("com.whatever.YourOwnParser", directory);
 *
 *    while (engine.hasNext()) {
 *       FTPFile[] files = engine.getNext(25);  // "page size" you want
 *       //do whatever you want with these files, display them, etc.
 *       //expensive FTPFile objects not created until needed.
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Paged access, using a parser accessible by auto-detect:
 * <pre>
 *    FTPClient f = new FTPClient();
 *    f.connect(server);
 *    f.login(username, password);
 *    FTPListParseEngine engine = f.initiateListParsing(directory);
 *
 *    while (engine.hasNext()) {
 *       FTPFile[] files = engine.getNext(25);  // "page size" you want
 *       //do whatever you want with these files, display them, etc.
 *       //expensive FTPFile objects not created until needed.
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * For examples of using FTPClient on servers whose directory listings
 * <ul>
 * <li>use languages other than English</li>
 * <li>use date formats other than the American English "standard" <code>MM d yyyy</code></li>
 * <li>are in different timezones and you need accurate timestamps for dependency checking
 *     as in Ant</li>
 * </ul>see {@link  FTPClientConfig  FTPClientConfig}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Control channel keep-alive feature</b>:<br/>
 * During file transfers, the data connection is busy, but the control connection is idle.
 * FTP servers know that the control connection is in use, so won't close it through lack of activity,
 * but it's a lot harder for network routers to know that the control and data connections are associated
 * with each other.
 * Some routers may treat the control connection as idle, and disconnect it if the transfer over the data
 * connection takes longer than the allowable idle time for the router.
 * <br/>
 * One solution to this is to send a safe command (i.e. NOOP) over the control connection to reset the router's
 * idle timer. This is enabled as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     ftpClient.setControlKeepAliveTimeout(300); // set timeout to 5 minutes
 * </pre>
 * This will cause the file upload/download methods to send a NOOP approximately every 5 minutes.
 * <p>
 * The implementation currently uses a {@link CopyStreamListener} which is passed to the
 * {@link Util#copyStream(InputStream, OutputStream, int, long, CopyStreamListener, boolean)}
 * method, so the timing is partially dependent on how long each block transfer takes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> this does not apply to the methods where the user is responsible for writing or reading
 * the data stream, i.e. {@link #retrieveFileStream(String)} , {@link #storeFileStream(String)}
 * and the other xxxFileStream methods
