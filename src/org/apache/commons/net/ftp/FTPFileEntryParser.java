/**
 * FTPFileEntryParser defines the interface for parsing a single FTP file
 * listing and converting that information into an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPFile} instance.
 * Sometimes you will want to parse unusual listing formats, in which
 * case you would create your own implementation of FTPFileEntryParser and
 * if necessary, subclass FTPFile.
 * <p>
 * Here are some examples showing how to use one of the classes that
 * implement this interface.
 * <p>
 *
 * The first example uses the <code>FTPClient.listFiles()</code>
 * API to pull the whole list from the subfolder <code>subfolder</code> in
 * one call, attempting to automatically detect the parser type.  This
 * method, without a parserKey parameter, indicates that autodection should
 * be used.
 *
 * <pre>
 *    FTPClient f=FTPClient();
 *    f.connect(server);
 *    f.login(username, password);
 *    FTPFile[] files = f.listFiles("subfolder");
 * </pre>
 *
 * The secondr example uses the <code>FTPClient.listFiles()</code>>
 * API to pull the whole list from the current working directory in one call,
 * but specifying by classname the parser to be used.  For this particular
 * parser class, this approach is necessary since there is no way to
 * autodetect this server type.
 *
 * <pre>
 *    FTPClient f=FTPClient();
 *    f.connect(server);
 *    f.login(username, password);
 *    FTPFile[] files = f.listFiles(
 *      "org.apache.commons.net.ftp.parser.EnterpriseUnixFTPFileEntryParser",
 *      ".");
 * </pre>
 *
 * The third example uses the <code>FTPClient.listFiles()</code>
 * API to pull a single file listing in an arbitrary directory in one call,
 * specifying by KEY the parser to be used, in this case, VMS.
 *
 * <pre>
 *    FTPClient f=FTPClient();
 *    f.connect(server);
 *    f.login(username, password);
 *    FTPFile[] files = f.listFiles("VMS", "subfolder/foo.java");
 * </pre>
 *
 * For an alternative approach, see the {@link FTPListParseEngine} class
 * which provides iterative access.
