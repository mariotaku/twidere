/**
 * This class handles the entire process of parsing a listing of
 * file entries from the server.
 * <p>
 * This object defines a two-part parsing mechanism.
 * <p>
 * The first part is comprised of reading the raw input into an internal
 * list of strings.  Every item in this list corresponds to an actual
 * file.  All extraneous matter emitted by the server will have been
 * removed by the end of this phase.  This is accomplished in conjunction
 * with the FTPFileEntryParser associated with this engine, by calling
 * its methods <code>readNextEntry()</code> - which handles the issue of
 * what delimits one entry from another, usually but not always a line
 * feed and <code>preParse()</code> - which handles removal of
 * extraneous matter such as the preliminary lines of a listing, removal
 * of duplicates on versioning systems, etc.
 * <p>
 * The second part is composed of the actual parsing, again in conjunction
 * with the particular parser used by this engine.  This is controlled
 * by an iterator over the internal list of strings.  This may be done
 * either in block mode, by calling the <code>getNext()</code> and
 * <code>getPrevious()</code> methods to provide "paged" output of less
 * than the whole list at one time, or by calling the
 * <code>getFiles()</code> method to return the entire list.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Paged access:
 * <pre>
 *    FTPClient f=FTPClient();
 *    f.connect(server);
 *    f.login(username, password);
 *    FTPListParseEngine engine = f.initiateListParsing(directory);
 *
 *    while (engine.hasNext()) {
 *       FTPFile[] files = engine.getNext(25);  // "page size" you want
 *       //do whatever you want with these files, display them, etc.
 *       //expensive FTPFile objects not created until needed.
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * For unpaged access, simply use FTPClient.listFiles().  That method
 * uses this class transparently.
