 * The CopyStreamListener class can accept CopyStreamEvents to keep track
 * of the progress of a stream copying operation.  However, it is currently
 * not used that way within NetComponents for performance reasons.  Rather
 * the bytesTransferred(long, int) method is called directly rather than
 * passing an event to bytesTransferred(CopyStreamEvent), saving the creation
 * of a CopyStreamEvent instance.  Also, the only place where
 * CopyStreamListener is currently used within NetComponents is in the
 * static methods of the uninstantiable org.apache.commons.io.Util class, which
 * would preclude the use of addCopyStreamListener and
 * removeCopyStreamListener methods.  However, future additions may use the
 * JavaBean event model, which is why the hooks have been included from the
 * beginning.
